5 different features and functionalities:

1. Header and navbar: This website has a gorgeous header and a responsive navbar with the facilities of active routes. 
2. Event cards: There are 6 different event cards in the home page. But if user want to view the details about a specific event , he/she has to  log in or register first.
Then the user can view the detail  page... I use privateRoute to implement this functionality
3: LogIn Page: If any user already have an account in our website then the user can can log in into out website in order to route freely.
4. Registration page: In the first visit, user have to register first. IN order to register user must input : 1. a valid email, 2. valid password including (uppercase, special character, numbers etc). After every successful login/ register a sweet alert will shown
5. Footer and errorPage: At the bottom there is a responsive footer section. I also use errorElement which redirects at 404 not found page if  any issue occurs in website

	getAuth()
	createUserWithEmailAndPassword()
	signInWithEmailAndPassword()
	signOut() etc
